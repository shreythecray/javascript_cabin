## Week 1 Step 5

### Git:

Run the following commands before starting:

In your main branch: `git pull` to pull any updates.

Delete your previous branches locally `git branch -d previousBranchName`, and remotely `git push origin --delete previousBranchName`

Change your branch to a new one for this step: `git checkout -b week-1-step-5`

`git pull` again just in case.

### Getting Access to Keys in app.js

Let's start with create a variable that gives us access to the Twit npm:

```
var Twit = require('twit')
```

Now we can create a variable that will hold all of our Twitter keys from the .env file. The way to access a variable from the .env file is to use `process.env.[var name]` (e.g. for the CONSUMER_KEY in .env you would use process.env.CONSUMER_KEY in app.js).
 
```
var T = new Twit({
  consumer_key:         '...',
  consumer_secret:      '...',
  access_token:         '...',
  access_token_secret:  '...',
  timeout_ms:           60*1000,  // optional HTTP request timeout to apply to all requests.
  strictSSL:            true,     // optional - requires SSL certificates to be valid.
})
```

### Get Tweets from Twitter

We will be using Twit to make a "GET" request from Twitter's API. Let's start with defining a regular (synchronous) function called getTweets(). This function does not need any parameters since all we're doing is making a request. This will also be the first function that we will run.

Search through the [Twit npm documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) to find how to make the GET request. You can customize this request to your own expectations. For example, I wanted to find 10 tweets with the hashtag #btsarmy since Jan 31st 2021, so my function looked like this:

```
function getTweets() {
     T.get('search/tweets', { q: '#btsarmy since:2021-01-31', count: 10 , language: 'en'}, function(err, data, response) {
      console.log(data)
    })
}
```

Save your file.

```
### Review:

**Add to your notes.md file:** why do you think we're using a GET request instead of a POST request? Research the difference between the two and explain.

**Make a PR:* will all new or changed files.
