## Week 1 Step 4

### Git:

Run the following commands before starting:

In your main branch: `git pull` to pull any updates.

Delete your previous branches locally `git branch -d previousBranchName`, and remotely `git push origin --delete previousBranchName`

Change your branch to a new one for this step: `git checkout -b week-1-step-5`

`git pull` again just in case.


### Setting Up Our APIs

### Create a .env file for your private keys

In this file you want to save and and all of your current and future private variables such as your Azure and Twitter keys.

How to write keys into the .env file:

```
key_name=random-key3458435348534
key2=sdkfdjfgjdfhjfdkhfdjh
```

In your app.js file, add the follow code at the top to allow this program to have access to the keys:

```
require('dotenv').config();
```

### Create a .gitignore file to protect your keys

The .gitignore will prevent files from being pushed into git when you commit your code. Add the following lines:

```
.DS_Store
/node_modules
.env
package-lock.json
```

You only need to add .DS_Store if you are using a Mac laptop.

### Setting up the Twitter API with Twit

Let's start with creating our Individual Developer Account on Twitter, which will allow us to get access to the Twitter API. First, log into twitter on the computer and navigate to the [developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/application/use-case) website. Once logged in, it will ask us some questions to guide us through the process of setting up the account. If you're not sure which option to select, choose "Exploring the API" under the "Hobbyist" column and click "Next."

We will need to make sure we have a valid phone number and email address associated with the account. Once you are done answering questions to verify your identify, you can submit the form and it will ask you for a unique application name - you can call it anything. In this case, I will name mine `BTweetS`.

Once we're on your Overview page, we can click on the Keys and Tokens button to get access to our API keys.

**Save your keys into your .env file.**

### Review:

**Add to your notes.md file:** why do we have a separate file for the keys? what does the .gitignore file do? what do the keys from the Twitter developer portal allow you to do?

**Make a Pull Request:** will all the files you have added or changed, including your notes.md file.
