## Week 1 Step 3

### Let's Get Started

### Packages

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) is an **open source developer tool ðŸ”¨** that allows developers to build JavaScript publicly available code, also known as, **packages**. We will be using npm to get access to:

- Lowdb: package for small databases ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb))
- Twit: Twitter API client for node ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit))
- Twilio

**[Read More about packages â€”>](https://cleverbeagle.com/blog/articles/what-are-javascript-packages-and-dependencies)**

**[Read More about npm â€”>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/)**

Don't have node installed? **[Read more about how you can install Node.js and npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)**

Before starting, we want to download a the Twit required for this app. Open your terminal in VS Code and run the following command.

If you run across any errors, feel free to troubleshoot on Google.

```
npm install twit
```

### Start Coding

**[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)** this current repository by copying the link to the repo and running the following code:

```
git init

git clone [link to repo]
```

Check which branch you're currently in (should say either `main` or `master`):

```
git branch
```

Create a new branch (this should automatically move you to the new branch you create):

```
git checkout -b week-1
```

Change branch to `week-1`:

```
git checkout week-1
```

Now we need to get access to the Twit package. In your local repo (the one that you just made), create a file within the folder called `app.js` add the following code to your `app.js` file:

```
var Twit = require('twit')
```

### Review:

**Add to your notes.md file:** describe in your own words what the `npm install` command allows us to do and what your app.js file can do at this moment and add the description into your notes.md file. Make a PR with your updated notes.md file as well as your new app.js file.
