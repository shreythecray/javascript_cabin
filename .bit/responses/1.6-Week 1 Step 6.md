## Week 1 Step 6

### Git:

Run the following commands before starting:

In your main branch: `git pull` to pull any updates.

Delete your previous branches locally `git branch -d previousBranchName`, and remotely `git push origin --delete previousBranchName`

Change your branch to a new one for this step: `git checkout -b week-1-step-5`

`git pull` again just in case.


### Going Async

Pulling in Tweets will take time. In order to be to able run the code timely without allowing other functions to overtake this one, we will need to implement an async function that will wait for our getTweets() to complete executing.

Async functions allow other operations to continue running as they are being executed (read more). Promises are sychnronous objects, similar to their real life meaning, return a value at some point in the future, or a reason for why that value could not be returned - they represent the result of an async function that may or may not be resolved.

[Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous? What the Hell is a Promise?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

[Master the JavaScript Interview: What is a Promise?](https://medium.com/better-programming/is-javascript-synchronous-or-asynchronous-what-the-hell-is-a-promise-7aa9dd8f3bfb)

Let's start with returning a promise in the getTweets() function.

```jsx
function getTweets() {
    //...code from last time.../
    
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve('resolved');
        }, 2000);
    });
    
}
```

Now we want to create the asynchronous function called waitForTweets(). The way that we can do this is by using the `await` keyword which will force waitForTweets() to wait for getTweets() to complete. Since a promise *returns* a value, we will need to assign the returning value to a variable, for example: `const result = await getTweets();`.

We will also need to use the result in some way, so for now we can print the result to the console and we're done!

```jsx
async function waitForTweets() {
    const result = await getTweets();
    console.log(result);
}
```

Run your code to see what happens.

### Review:

**Add to notes.md:** what do you think the setTimeout function call does in getTweets()? If you're not sure, feel free to look it up.

**Make a PR** will all new or updated files.
